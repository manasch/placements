[comment]: # (Summary of the sections and experience below this comment.)

3 Questions:
1. SQL (1)
2. Coding (2)

### Coding Questions

1. **Find the 2nd largest value**: Write an SQL statement to print the second largest value from a column, if it doesn't exist, then print null.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT PRICE FROM PRODUCTS ORDER BY PRICE DESC LIMIT 1, 1;
```
- Should have worked but didn't.

2. **Lines passing through special point**: Given a 2D plane and a special point (p) and n other points (x1, x2...xn). Find the number of pairs of points amongst the n points that pass through the special point.

> Finding the slope of each point wrt to the special point, if for some slope m, there are q number of points with the same slope, then the number of pairs of lines that pass through the special point would be `(q * (q - 1))/2`
