## Round 1

17/08/23

[comment]: # (Summary of the sections and experience below this comment.)

### Coding Questions

1. **Distances Between Nodes**: Given a list of elements, create a BST out of the list of elements, and every time a new element is added to the BST, find the distance (the number of edges between every pair of nodes in the BST) of every possible pair and print the sum.

- This but after creating a BST.

2. **Circular Linked List**: Given a list of elements, create a circular linked list in a sorted order, don't assume the first element to be the smallest, after creating the list. Insert 5 to the linked list and print out the values in ascending order.

[comment]: # (Add any resources or links or code to this question under this comment.)

- Remember take input this way
```cpp
while (cin >> t)
```

3. **Decompositions of powers of 2**: Given a list of elements, decompose them into powers of 2 after which if some particular power of 2 appears odd number of times among all the decompositions combined, print that value.

[comment]: # (Add any resources or links or code to this question under this comment.)

- Take XOR of all values, this way only the bits in binary would be set that appear odd number of times, then print that power.
