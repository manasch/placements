Problems were random and of various difficulty levels. As a team of 3, we had to solve 6 questions in total mentioned below.\nGiven n strings, determine the pair with the max value product. n is upto 10^6 and each string has max length of 20. The strings can contain alphanumeric characters. If a string contains any numeric character, it\u0026rsquo;s value is the integer concatenation of all numeric characters. Otherwise, it is the length of the string. Convert all strings to their values and find the two biggest values. Multiply them to get the answer.\nExample:\n3 abc a01 a42 Answer: Values are [3, 1, 42]. Max product is 42 * 3 = 126 n = int(input()) s = input().split() a = [] for i in s: if i.isnumeric(): a.append(int(i)) else: value = 0 has_numeric = False for j in i: if j.isnumeric(): value = value * 10 + int(j) has_numeric = True if not has_numeric: value = len(i) a.append(value) a.sort() print(a[-1] * a[-2]) Find the longest subsequence in an array such that each element is 3 times more than the previous element. n is upto 100 and a[i] is upto 2000. #include \u0026lt;cmath\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdio\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;vector\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;algorithm\u0026gt; void solve() { int n; std::cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; n; std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; a(n); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; ++i) std::cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[i]; std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; dp(n + 1); for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt;= n; ++i) { int max = 0; for (int j = 1; j \u0026lt; i; ++j) { if (a[j - 1] * 3 == a[i - 1]) max = std::max(max, dp[j]); } dp[i] = 1 + max; } std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; *std::max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end()) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } int main() { std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(nullptr); solve(); return 0; } Given a number, repeatedly find the sum of digits and replace the number.

You are given a string s of length 2n-2 with upper and lower case characters. Lower case characters represent keys and Upper case characters represent rooms. All odd indices (1-based) are keys and even indices are rooms. To unlock a room, you need to have its corresponding key. Count the number of rooms for which you\u0026rsquo;ll have to additionally purchase keys if you start from room 1 and visit all rooms in the order given in the string. Example:\n4 aAbBcC Answer: 0. You can visit all rooms without purchasing any keys. 5 aAcBbCaB Answer: 1. You need to purchase key `b` for room `B` at index 4 (1-based). #include \u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; void solve() { int n; std::string s; std::cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; n \u0026gt;\u0026gt; s; std::multiset\u0026lt;char\u0026gt; keys; int ans = 0; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n - 1; ++i) { char key = s[2 * i]; char door = s[2 * i + 1]; keys.insert(key); auto f = keys.find(std::tolower(door)); if (f == keys.end()) ++ans; else keys.erase(f); } std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ans \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;; } int main() { std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(nullptr); solve(); return 0; } You are given a string s and integer k. You need to encode the string using the following algorithm: Traverse s from left to right If the character is a vowel, you need to increment k by 2. Otherwise, increment k by 1. The value corresponding to the current character is its ASCII value times k Example:\nabecd 1 Answer: [291, 392, 606, 693, 800] 0: 97 * 3 = 291 1: 98 * 4 = 392 2: 101 * 5 = 606 3: 99 * 6 = 693 4: 100 * 7 = 800 Solution is to simulate the above behaviour.\nGiven n numbers, count the unique numbers subject to the following constraints: A number is unique if it is the maximum number in the collection and has only one occurrence. If maximum number has more than one occurrence, it is not unique and all its occurrences are removed from the collection. If maximum number has only one occurrence, it is unique. The number max is removed from the occurence and floor(max / 2) is added to the collection if it is greater than 0. Example:\n5 1 2 3 4 5 Answer: 3 0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], unique = 0 + 1 = 1 (5 is unique) 1: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], unique = 1 + 1 = 2 (4 is unique) 2: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3], unique = 2 + 0 = 2 (3 is not unique and all occurrences are removed) 3: [1, 2, 2], unique = 2 + 0 = 2 (2 is not unique and all occurrences are removed) 4: [1], unique = 2 + 1 = 3 (1 is unique) 5: [], answer = 3 #include \u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; int main() { std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(nullptr); int n; std::cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; n; std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; v(n); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; ++i) std::cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; v[i]; std::map\u0026lt;int, int\u0026gt; map; for (int i: v) ++map[i]; int ans = 0; while (!map.empty()) { auto [k, v] = *map.rbegin(); map.erase(k); if (k / 2 \u0026gt; 0) ++map[k / 2]; if (v == 1) ans += 1; } std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; ans \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;; return 0; } Round 3 (Ideation) 03/10/2023 - 10/10/2023\nYet to happen.\nRound 4 (Prototype) 12-10-2023 - 24-10-2023\nYet to happen.\nRound 5 (Finale) 03-11-2023 - 05-11-2023\nYet to happen.\n","permalink":"https://manasch.github.io/placements/code/amazon_hackon/","summary":"Amazon HackOn 2023 Details Job Status Hackathon.

Some of these nodes are connected to each other. This is represented with a list of undirected edges between two nodes. Nodes that are directly or indirectly connected to each other are part of the same region.\nEach node has their respective database connection, such that whenever a query is called, it will record it in their respective database.\nThere are q queries, each query of the following type:\n\u0026ldquo;1 pod_id\u0026rdquo;: Represents a normal query to the node pod_id. \u0026ldquo;2 pod_id\u0026rdquo;: Represents a disconnect to the database for the mentioned pod_id. (This disconnect is irreversible, once disconnected, cannot be reconnected) If a query is for a node whose database connection is down (due to a prior database disconnect query), this query is forwarded to the smallest valued node in the region the initial requested node belongs to and is written to that node\u0026rsquo;s database. Return the node which makes the database call. (Smallest if requested is down, else the requested node).\nIf the query is for a node whose database connection is down, and every other node in its region is also down, then the query is not written and is lost.
