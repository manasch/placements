## Round 1

> 16/09/23

[comment]: # (Summary of the sections and experience below this comment.)

There were 17 Questions to be solved in 1.5 hours
1. MCQ (15)
2. Coding (2)

### Coding Questions

1. **Telephone Lines**: There are M houses and N localities, your job as a city planner is to design a plan such that atleast one house exists in a locality.

    In a locality, all the houses have a telephone line connected to each other `(n*(n-1)/2)`. Generate two plans to find out the maximum and minimum number of telephone lines that will be required across all the localities.

> Max would be generated when all localities except one has 1 house, and the rest in the last locality. The min would be when the houses are equally distributed across all localities.

2. **New Neighbours**: There are M houses built in a row and there are N people wanting to move into the houses. (N <= M). Everyone wants to stay as far away as possible from each other, what would be the maximised minimum distance between the houses.

    An array of size M is provided which has the distances from the front gate. Assign the N people to the houses such that they are as far away as possible from each other.

> Perform a binary search to determine the distance between the houses and keep updating the minimum distance.
