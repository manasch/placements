2. **Max Price**: Given a tree which has nodes from 1-n which refer to the version of some product. Each node has a value V associated to it.
    For each node, find the max product of 2 values in the subtree (The subtree includes the node being considered). If the node is a leaf node, then the max product would be 0.

    Return a list where list[i] = max product of the subtree for the ith node. (Assume 1-indexing)

    ```
    V -> [-10^5, 10^5]
    N -> [1, ?]
    ```

3. **Folder Count**: An existing folder structure is provided which shows the parent-child relationship between different folders.

    'folder-1' is always the root.

    The existing folder structure is given as follows:
    ```
    folder-1 a
    folder-1 b
    a c
    b d


        folder-1
          /\
         a  b
        /    \
       c      d
    ```

    3 kinds of queries can be performed
    - mkdir a b : Create a new folder b under a.
    - rmdir a : Remove the folder a and all of its subfolders.
    - count a : Return the count of all the subfolders including itself.

    Given n queries amongst which c of them are the count query, return a list of size c holding the count for the respective folder count function call.
