### Coding Questions

1. **Smallest Common Substring**: Given two strings, find the number of mappings of the common substrings between the two stirngs.

> Don't have to consider subtrings, since they're asking for smallest, it just becomes the individual characters. Create a charCount for both and multiply and add the count for each character.
