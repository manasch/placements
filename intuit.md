    N x M matrix and each cell contains a value ranging from -1000 to 1000, both N and M can range from 1 to 1000.

    Given a ball which can start from any location, the ball can move to the right or down to its adjacent neighbor. If the ball goes from x1 y1 to x2 y2 (right or down), then the reward obtained is `matrix[x2][y2] - matrix[x1][y1]`.

    Find the largest reward that can be obtained in the path where the ball moves only right or down.
